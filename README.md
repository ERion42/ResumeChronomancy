Once there, all you need to do is click the login button (if you're a returning user) or signup button (if you're a first time user). You can enjoy some of the other pages, such as the delightful slideshow on the landing page or the frequently asked questions section. There's even a little bit about our team, but most of us were too shy (or modest) to brag about ourselves so we used Lorem Hipster as a placeholder.

Once signed in, you'll be taken to your dashboard. You shouldn't have any information at first, so you'll want to add that in. By clicking each of the tabs at the top, you'll navigate to different pages where you can input your user information. This will include skills, education, experience, and personal information.

## Contributing

We want to continue adding to this build. If you'd like to make suggestions, please feel free to reach out to us. We'd love to hear ideas for how to improve, but keep in mind this is very much a minimum viable product. We know a lot of styling needs to be done, and we need to be able to actually output a PDF resume!

## Tests

To run tests, run the following command:

```
npm test
```

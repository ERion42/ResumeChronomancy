Sidebar : For quick access to resume building functions
Saved Resumes : Opens a dropdown menu of saved resumes (do we want a maximum number?)
Create Profile (This should be to add the user's experience, right?)
Generate Resume (This would be to actually generate a finished resume)
Visual Timeline (See experience with gaps)


Landing Page : First thing people see when they arrive - could probably cycle to "home"

Home: Self-explanatory

Dashboard :

Resume : We might want to redefine this one 

FAQs: Pretty easy to set up

About: Again, easy set-up


Plan for 11/24:
Eric - Create home page, add nav and side bars
Garrett - Code about, FAQ, and Landing Page
